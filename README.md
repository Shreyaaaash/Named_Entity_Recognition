# Named_Entity_Recognition
News Article Popularity Prediction with Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the popularity of news articles based on engagement metrics, utilizing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract valuable information from the articles and engineer features for predictive modeling.

The steps involved are as follows:

Text Preprocessing
Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Feature Engineering
Predictive Modeling
Visualization and Insights
Dataset
This project uses the News Articles Dataset, which includes news articles from various sources.

Methodology
1. Data Collection
The dataset provides a collection of news articles, which will be cleaned and analyzed to extract relevant information.
2. Text Preprocessing
Remove unnecessary whitespace, HTML tags, and special characters from the articles.
Normalize text by converting it to lowercase.
Tokenize the text and remove stop words using libraries like NLTK or SpaCy.
3. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Use an open-source LLM model (SpaCy or Hugging Face) to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER).
Entities will be categorized into types such as Organization (ORG), Location (GPE), and Person (PERSON).
Numerical features will be created based on the frequency of these entities in each article.
4. Feature Engineering
Combine the entity counts with other features:
Article Length: The number of words in each article.
Sentiment Score: Using TextBlob or VADER for sentiment analysis.
Engagement Metrics: Metrics like likes, shares, and comments (if available in the dataset).
Additional Features: Any creative or innovative features derived to enhance the model.
5. Predictive Modeling
A predictive model will be trained using the engineered features.
Models like Linear Regression or Random Forest will be used, and their performance will be evaluated using:
Accuracy Score
F1-Score
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
6. Visualization
Visualizations will be created to show the relationship between named entities and article popularity:
Bar Charts: Displaying the frequency of entities in the dataset.
Scatter Plots: Showing correlations between entity counts and article popularity.
Heatmaps: Showing the relationship between engagement metrics and the frequency of named entities.
Getting Started
